# Break Mod

## What Does It Do?
Playing for extended amounts of time can <cr>damage your eyes</c>, meaning it is important to take breaks!

This mod reminds you to take breaks when playing or editing a level for an extended amount of time!
This mod is designed around GD, meaning **you will NOT be interrupted during an attempt or while playtesting in the editor!**

## Configuration:

You can easily configure this mod through the mod settings menu, which you can also open through the timer settings popup found in the in-game pause menus!

It is recommended to use 20 minute intervals and 20 seconds for the amont of time to take as a break.

## Support
